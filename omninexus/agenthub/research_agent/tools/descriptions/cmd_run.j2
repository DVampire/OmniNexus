        <NAME>execute_bash</NAME>
        <DESCRIPTION>
            Execute a bash command in the terminal.
            * Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&amp;1 &amp;`.
            * Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command=`ctrl+c` to interrupt the process.
            * Timeout: If a command execution result says "Command timed out. Sending SIGINT to the process", the assistant should retry running the command in the background.
